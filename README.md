# Go Language Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Go Language Learning Journey** üöÄ

This repository contains code snippets, examples, and notes as I explore the Go programming language.

## Learning Resource

I am learning Go from [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/), an excellent practical guide to understanding Go concepts through examples.

## About Go

Go is an open-source programming language designed at Google that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Official Website: [https://go.dev/](https://go.dev/)

## Repository Structure

- [`basics/`](./basics/): Fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals.
- [`functions/`](./functions/): Function definitions and examples.
- [`structs/`](./structs/): Structs and methods.
- [`goroutines/`](./goroutines/): Concurrency examples.
- [`channels/`](./channels/): Channel communication examples.
- [`errors/`](./errors/): Error handling.
- [`interfaces/`](./interfaces/): Interfaces and polymorphism.

## How to Run the Code

1. Install Go from the official website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
3. Run Go programs:
   ```bash
   go run filename.go
   ```
